# Emacs package textsize

This simple Emacs package automatically calculates and adjusts the default text size for the size and pixel pitch of the display.

This is useful when switching between diverse displays on laptops, monitors and large scale displays such as TVs.

For more description, usage and configuration details, see the header text in  [textsize.el](./textsize.el).
